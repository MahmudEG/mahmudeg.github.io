## Let's Start
### 1. **Manage Azure identities and governance

#### - Users


#### - Groups
- **Microsoft 365 Groups** are used for collaboration between users, both inside and outside your company. They include collaboration services such as SharePoint and Planner. Microsoft Teams uses Microsoft 365 Groups for membership.
- **Distribution groups** are used for sending email notifications to a group of people.
- **Security groups** are used for granting access to resources such as SharePoint sites.
- **Mail-enabled security groups** are used for granting access to resources such as SharePoint, and emailing notifications to those users.
- **Shared mailboxes** are used when multiple people need access to the same mailbox, such as a company information or support email address.
- **Dynamic distribution groups** are created to expedite the mass sending of email messages and other information within an organization.
